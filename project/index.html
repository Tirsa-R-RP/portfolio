                I created wireframes that are similar to the actual look of the
                app but only highlighted the text relevant to achieving the goal
                of applying for föräldrapenning (parental leave payments).
                <br />
                <br />Two key ui patterns that users found very helpful for
                navigating through the site and achieving their goal, were
                Breadcrumbs and Catergorization. No matter where the user was in
                the process, they could always find their way around the site
                with these ui patterns.
                <br />
                <br />Two ui patterns that some found frustrating in the
                application were the continuous scrolling and not being able to
                skip or come back to steps. There was so much information to be
                read and inputted, that it felt like it went on forever when
                scrolling through the app. They tried to address this with
                accordian menus, but there was still a lot of information
                overwhelming the user. Then while actively in the steps left
                wizard, the user did not have the option to stop and save their
                work to come back at a later time. They can’t even skip ahead to
                see what kind of information they will need for the next step.
                It would be helpful to be able to hop around the questions and
                get back to it once you have all the information at hand and
                time to finish all the steps.

              <p>
                The app I deconstructed and reconstructed was the
                Fösäkringskassan app. Försäkringskassan is Sweden's social
                welfare agency that pays people when they are unable to work.
                <br />
                <br />The goal I focused on was applying for parental leave
                compensation. A parent will need to complete this workflow in
                order to get paid while on maternity/paternity leave.
                <br />
                <br />When selecting an app, I posted in a few Facebook forums
                for mothers in Sweden as well as contacted a few of my friends
                who are mothers. Most of them said they had issues with the
                Försäkringskassan app. Not only with applying for maternity
                leave, but also for VAB and other services. I explored the app
                and eventually decided on the Försäkringskassan app. With the
                specific goal of applying for maternity leave payments as my
                focus. It is a service that I had to use when I was on maternity
                leave, so I was familiar with the process already. I took some
                of their feedback into consideration and made a reconstruction.
                <br />
                <br />The app doesn't make a good first impression, the first
                thing the user encounters when they open the app on their phone
                is a prompt that they will be redirected to the website.

                In the current app the user is notified that they will be
                redirected to the website outside of the app. In this
                reconstruction, the user can access the app without being
                prompted to go into their browser.
                <br />
                <br />The user is already confronted with a mass of information
                that can be found after continuously scrolling. I would
                reconstruct it by creating an accordion menu that highlights the
                different topics all on one screen. If the user wants to learn
                more about that topic, they will have access to the vast amount
                of information provided.

              <p>
                Once the user selects the förälder (parent) link they are
                presented with the three most used services at the top. This
                allows the user to see what they most likely came to the app
                for, without having to search around the site.
                <br />
                <br />But as the user currently scrolls down there are topic
                links with short descriptions of what can be found once they
                click on that link. But those links just lead to more links and
                descriptions. In my reconstruction, the user can see their
                options on one screen and pick which topic they really want to
                proceed to. That way most of the work is still done on this
                page, instead of jumping from link to link.

                In the pages leading up to this page, there are cards, then a
                list of links, then cards again. It is inconsistent in its
                display and layout. In this reconstruction the set up is more in
                line with the previous pages to keep things consistent.
                <br />
                <br />I also added two more banking options in the app that are
                found on the full website version but are not currently offered
                in the app. That way if users need to log in using these
                methods, they can access them immediately rather than having to
                wait until they can sit in front of a computer.
                <br />
                <br />Logging in with BankID is something that most people are
                familiar with in Sweden. It is used for most government services
                as well as with making payments, such as Swish. Therefore, the
                help and related links sections can be put into accordion menus.
                Users will most likely not need them, but if they do, they are
                easily accessible without adding to the cognitive load of most
                users.

                In my reconstruction I would move the BankID process into the
                Försäkringskassan app. It would be much more straightforward and
                take a lot less effort if the BankID process could be embedded
                into the actual app.

              <p>
                As of now, the users need to close the application, find their
                BankID app on their phone, open it, input their personal numbers
                and pin codes, then navigate back to the original application. A
                lot of people purposely do not put their BankID app on the first
                page of their phone for safety reasons. This navigating through
                apps on a phone becomes more of an inconvenience and breaks the
                flow of the user experience.
                <br />
                <br />One positive aspect of the BankID experience is the input
                feedback (or feedforward) in the input fields. This allows the
                user to know exactly how to input their codes and avoid
                mistakes.

              <p>
                This is where the parent starts the application process. They
                first must select which child they would like to apply for and
                fill in their income information.
                <br />There are currently small information buttons found by
                each header. However, they don’t provide any new information
                other than what is already stated on the page. In my
                reconstruction, I would remove some of the cognitive load by
                moving the explanation text into the information pop up. If a
                user needs more information, they can find it, but usually this
                is a process they will complete every month. After that initial
                onboarding period, the parent will not need to have the whole
                process explained every time.
                <br />
                <br />I have also dimmed the information of the child that has
                reached their limit of days being taken. That will provide the
                user with some feedforward, that it is most likely the other
                child they are looking into. The other parent might still have
                days available to them, so removing the child from the list is
                not ideal. But this does let the user know that all their days
                were used up and allows them to focus on the child with days
                left.
                <br />
                <br />Another change in this step left process, is that the
                continue button at the bottom lets the user continue onto the
                next page, even if they have not filled in all the information.
                By being able to skip to the next page, the user can see what
                information they will need to fill out the application, or just
                browse around for more information regarding planning. They
                might want to play around with the dates and hours to see what
                works best for them, without actually submitting the
                application.

                This page was very similar to the others with the cognitive load
                of information overwhelming the user. There are two areas where
                they restate which child you are applying for, even though you
                just selected which child on the previous page.
                <br />There is another information button that doesn’t provide
                any additional information than that which is already displayed.
                <br />Then there is another section that takes up a lot of space
                that tells the user that if they want their application to be
                processed, they must complete the later steps.
                <br />
                <br />I removed the first section which restates which child you
                are picking days for, since it is found further down with that
                child’s personal number and a chart of days. I moved the
                information and “change an earlier application” sections into
                accordion menus, since they do not always need to be displayed.
                I then removed that unnecessary continue to finish section and
                moved the “estimated compensation” disclaimer information into
                the information button near the header. It is something that I
                assume needs to be posted, to let users know this is just a
                preliminary estimate, but it took up a lot of space and mental
                capacity to read the whole paragraph. When all the user really
                wants to do is pick days from a calendar picker and see how many
                days are left of each type of compensation. Instead of needing
                to scroll through a lot of text to get to the pertinent
                information.

              <p>
                This page’s layout is very clear and concise, I would only
                change two aspects of the functionality.
                <br />I would add the ability for the user to skip ahead if they
                wanted to. As well as change the order of the “no” and “yes” on
                the last question. On the current app they change the order of
                the yes and no on the last question as opposed to the three
                previous questions.
                <br />
                <br />I wonder what the reasoning was for chaning the order. It
                could be to help the users who might not be paying attention to
                click “yes” as the first option, because they do want to apply
                again after this application. But it could also be adverse to
                the user’s desires and lead them to click “no” by accident,
                preventing them from applying again. If they weren’t paying
                close attention, they might not notice that the order changed at
                the last moment.

                This is where the user can double check that all the information
                they entered, is correct. In this reconstruction, I would remove
                some of the excess and repetitive information. Such as where
                they restate the questions from the previous page, I left the
                topic and their answer.
                <br />
                <br />There is a postal preference section that I removed. That
                seems like something that should be under “my pages” where the
                user sets up their account. That isn’t as relevant to their goal
                in this section of the site. But included an information button,
                so if the user wishes to change their postal preference, they
                know where to go in the set-up section of “my pages”.
                <br />
                <br />I left the option to update a phone number and bank
                account, as those two things are important when applying for
                payment. But I moved the excess information into the information
                button near the header.

              <p>
                Overall, I felt like Försäkringskassan has done a decent job
                with a difficult task. They are a government organization that
                deals with very important issues such as compensation when a
                person is unable to work. There can be a lot of emotions
                involved when a person is unable to work and needs to seek
                assistance from a government agency. Those emotions are with the
                user while they try to sift through all the information to reach
                their goal. Any frustrations or feelings of being overwhelmed by
                an application, can contribute to an already stressful personal
                situation.
                <br />
                <br />There is a plethora of information that the user and
                Försäkringskassan are required to provide. Which results in a
                mass of information that the user needs to navigate through to
                get to what is relevant to them and their needs. They provide
                the user with many tips, information buttons, feedforward as
                well as input feedback. This makes inputting information easier,
                as well as decreases the chance of the user making a mistake.
                They also provide plenty of ways for the user to find out where
                they are at and find their way back to where they started using;
                breadcrumbs, navigation tabs, a home link, and search option.
                <br />
                <br />What I tried to achieve in my reconstruction is to relieve
                some of the cognitive load by taking out redundant information.
                I tried giving the user options. The option to choose if they
                want to be exposed to certain information or not. To decide what
                is relevant to them, and if it isn’t, then they don’t need to
                click the accordion menu. The option to input or not input
                information, but still be allowed to move along the step left
                process to see the possibilities. By filtering out text and not
                overwhelming the user and giving them options. They will
                hopefully feel like they are more in control of the situation
                and not simply inputting information because they must. But feel
                like they are choosing to put in this information because it
                helps them reach their goal. Thus, resulting in a better
                experience and more online applications as opposed to paper or
                in-person applications submitted to Försäkringskassan.
